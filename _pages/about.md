I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Data Science at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/endex.html), advised by Prof. [Yixiang Fang](https://fangyixiang.github.io/), and working closely with Prof. [Chenhao Ma](https://chenhao-ma.github.io/) and [Wensheng Luo](https://gearlessl.github.io/wensheng/). I got my Master degree from Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen in June 2022, under the supervision of Prof. [Yunming Ye](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n30nnskAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in June 2020. 

I am always open for possible collaborations, and visiting opportunities, please do not hesitate to [contact me](yinglizhou@link.cuhk.edu.cn) if you are interested!
# Interests
My  research interests mainly focus on large-scale data management and data mining, particularly graph data management and Large Language Models (LLMs) for data management. Specifically, my research spans the following topics: 
- Data+LLM: efficient RAG systems and methods, effective tool use, and optimized plan execution in multi-agent systems.
- Graph data management/mining: densest subgraph discovery, community search, clique listing/counting.
- AI4DB: latency prediction, cardinality estimation.

Yingli is working hard 😭😭😭 to produce impactful 🔥 and novel work 🌟. 
In addition, I am passionate about open-source communities and familiar with database kernels (such as TiDB).


## LLM-based projects

### 1. Graph-based RAG system
