I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Data Science at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/endex.html), advised by Prof. [Yixiang Fang](https://fangyixiang.github.io/). I got my Master degree from Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen in June 2022, under the supervision of Prof. [Yunming Ye](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n30nnskAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in June 2020. 

I am always open for possible collaborations, and visiting opportunities, please do not hesitate to [contact me](yinglizhou@link.cuhk.edu.cn) if you are interested!
# Interests
My  research interests mainly focus on large-scale data management and data mining, particularly graph data management and Large Language Models (LLMs) for data management. Specifically, my research spans the following topics: 
- Build **<font color="#a0c3f0">efficient and lightweight ðŸš€ graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods and systems </font>** to enhance the factual accuracy, adaptability, interpretability, and trustworthiness of next-generation language models.
- Design simple yet effective algorithms ðŸ’« for graph mining, utilizing linear programming and spectral methods, focusing on  densest subgraph discovery and graph clustering. 
- Develop tools ðŸ”§ or systems ðŸ”¨ that leverage LLMs for data analysis tasks, such as Data2Insight and data cleaning.

Yingli is working hard ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ to produce impactful ðŸ”¥ and novel work ðŸŒŸ.
