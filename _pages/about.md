I'm a first year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html), advised by Prof. [Michael R. Lyu](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/home). I got my Master's degree from Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen in June 2023, under the supervision of Prof. [Cuiyun Gao](https://cuiyungao.github.io/). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from Harbin Institute of Technology Weihai in June 2021.

My research mainly focuses on software engineering and code intelligence. Code intelligence leverages artificial intelligence techniques to analyze and generate source code, which could benefit a variety of software engineering activities and tasks such as program repair, defect detection, and code summarization etc. Besides, I also have a wide interest in the development of code intelligence models in real-world scenario and the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for software engineering. Specifically, my research interest lies in the span of the following topics:

1. Code analysis and generation: code representation learning, code generation, static analysis

2. Code intelligence in real-world scenario: robustness, data imbalance, continual learning

3. LLM for software engineering: in-context learning, chain of thought, tool using
