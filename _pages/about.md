I'm a Second-year Ph.D. student in the School of Data Science at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/endex.html), advised by Prof. [Yixiang Fang](https://fangyixiang.github.io/), and have a closely connection with Prof. [Chenhao Ma](https://chenhao-ma.github.io/). I got my Master degree from Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen in June 2022, under the supervision of Prof. [Yunming Ye](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n30nnskAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in June 2020. 


# Interests
My  research interests mainly focus on large-scale data management and data mining, particularly graph data management and Large Language Models (LLMs) for data management. Specifically, my research interest lies in the span of the following topics:

- Graph data management: community search, cohesive subgraph search,  motif counting, knowledge graph construction
- Graph mining: densest subgraph discovery, clique algorithm, temporal graph learning
- LLM for data management: data cleaning, data collection, insight mining
